    <h1>My Contributions to Dungeons and Dragons: Online</h1>
    <p>I worked on DDO from 2016-2024. Everything listed here is a patch note for which I was directly responsible. If you'd like to see some analysis of my body of work, I've provided some statistics under the "Show Stats" button in the control panel. <br><span class="patch">List items in blue were added in a subsequent patch.</span></p>

      <p>This graph shows the aggregate amount of changes made in an update divided by the days since the previous update. For example, if an update had 50 total changes across all categories, and came out 50 days after the previous update, that update's aggregate score would be 1. That being said, that's not the full story - this data also takes into account that some changes were launched post-release, as those were being worked on during the next update's release cycle. So the true amount of changes in a given update is actually the number of launch changes + the total number of patch-released changes of the previous update. This means that in our earlier example, if those 50 changes were actually 20 launch changes and 30 patch changes, but the previous update had 5 patch changes, the update's true aggregate score is 0.5, as 20 + 5 / 50 = 0.5.</p>
      <p>It should also probably be noted that all of this analysis on the basis of "productivity" is by definition exceptionally flawed because it treats large features that took months of effort and many hands with the same weight as taking two minutes to fix a typo in a decade-old piece of content. It also downplays the tremendous, amazing efforts of my team, without whom I'd never be able to do any of the things that I do. That being said, I like graphs - so here we are!</p>
      <p id = "StatsTextExtra">The update with the highest aggregate score is <a id="AggregateLink" class="UpdateLink">$UPDATENAME$</a> with a score of <span class="value">$VALUE1$</span>. This is because I made <span class="value">$VALUE2$</span> total changes over the course of <span class="value">$VALUE3$</span> days.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Epic Destiny Refresh</li>
          <li>Active Tumbling Overhaul
            <ul>
              <li>Tumbling is now limited by charges. If you don't have at least one Tumble charge, you cannot tumble. By default, you have 2 maximum Tumble charges, and one Tumble charge returns every 8 seconds.</li>
              <li>Certain feats and abilities now boost your maximum Tumble charges and quicken their rate of return:
                <ul>
                  <li>Thief-Acrobat's 3rd core, Tumbler, now grants +1 maximum Tumble charge.</li>
                  <li>The Mobility feat now grants +1 maximum Tumble charge.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>You may view your Tumble charges by holding your Block key, default left shift. Each green pip displayed represents one Tumble charge.</li>
              <li>Tumble now grants you defensive benefits during part of the tumble animation. These bonuses only apply if you are actually tumbling - the shuffle half-step will not trigger these bonuses.
                <ul>
                  <li>+95% uncapped Dodge for 1 second in light or no armor, +75% uncapped Dodge for 1 second in medium armor, +50% uncapped Dodge for 1 second in heavy armor.</li>
                  <li>A bonus to Reflex saving throws equal to your Tumble skill for 1 second.</li>
                  <li>Note that these bonuses apply to you from the moment you begin your Tumble, regardless of how long the animation takes to complete.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Tooltip Update
            <ul>
              <li>All action lines other than description are now in a bulleted list.</li>
              <li>There is now an empty space between the automatically generated stuff and its description.</li>
              <li>Duplicate information (such as the duplicate cooldown line when hovering over a spellBOOK entry or Spell information in enhancement tree tooltips) has been removed.</li>
              <li>Save information is now color coded (between fort, will, and reflex).</li>
              <li>Spell Resistance information is now color coded and presented only if the Spell Resistance check is active (aka you will see Spell Resistance! only if the ability needs it, and not Spell Resistance NO on everything that doesn't)</li>
              <li>If you have material components eschewed via a character ability, the spell now reports this on a per-slot-basis (because you can assign eschew on a per-slot basis) instead of just telling you that you don't have the materials.</li>
              <li>We no longer display a Spell Point cost of 0 on abilities with no SP costs.</li>
              <li>Hit Point costs of abilities are now reported in RED, and Ki costs are now reported in YELLOW.</li>
              <li>Abilities that are self-targeted toggles now say "Toggle Ability" instead of just "Target: Self" which, while technically true, isn't the most helpful information.</li>
              <li>Fixed bug where druid abilities reported wrong DCs.</li>
              <li>Fixed bug where certain projectile spells had the wrong DCs.</li>
              <li>Antirequisites now display in Enhancement Trees and Destiny Trees.</li>

          <li>Action Point costs of several abilities have been adjusted to try to get this tree closer to the goal of 60-ish AP for all abilities like other Destiny Trees. It's still below other trees, but now the margin is less severe.</li>

          <li class="commentary"><span class="base">Battle Engineer cores now properly provide their Universal Spell Power.</span><span class="tooltip">This bug was caused by an order of operations failure within our visual scripting system. Imagine a set of switch results that return a value based on a key - in this case, charge tier - but the statements are ordered like so: "if charge tier is greater than 0, return 0. if charge tier is greater than 1, return 1." Because the first check precludes the second for any value, the subsequent charge tiers would cease to function as they were unlocked. This was fixed by nesting the script checks such that the check for tier 1 would happen within check 0, and would continue on to tiers 2 and 3 and so on without hitting an erroneous dead end. Honestly quite a fun bug to run down.</span></li>

        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="engineering">
        <h3>Engineering:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>There is a new gameplay option: Show Detailed Chest Information (Default: false). While true, the first time you touch a chest (and generate its loot) the chest will print out some information about its ransack info into your chat log. Only you can see this info.</li>
          <li>A series of changes have been made to tooltip generation:<ul>
          <li>The names of Feats and Enhancements are now bigger in their tooltips to make it easier to parse what they are.</li>
          <li>SLA tooltips now display spell info, such as their spell point cost, spell DC, and spell school, automatically.</li>
          <li>Certain aspects of enhancements no longer show in the tooltip (such as prerequisites) if you own the enhancement and are looking via your character sheet. When hovered over in the tree they will show their AP cost and prerequisites as usual.</ul></li></li>
          <li>A series of large changes have been made to how we display Feats to the players:<ul>
          <li>Character Creation:<ul>
          <li>Feats now display in neat categories that are easier to parse and sort through.</li>
          <li>The summary at the bottom and at the last stage in advancement shows you all feats without category view so that you just get a list of what feats you have without them being condensed underneath a click block.</li>
          <li>The collapse/expand button up top plays nice with them so you can collapse all/expand all with one click.</li></ul></li>
          <li>Character Sheet:<ul>
          <li>Feats now display in neat categories that are easier to parse and sort through.</li>
          <li>Collapse/expand button works with them.</li>
          <li>Feats that are acquired on a temporary basis now display an indicator below their name stating as such.</li></ul></li>
          <li>Level Up Screen:<ul>
          <li>Categories now have well formatted labels that actually match the +/- button in relative vertical area, which makes everything look a little nicer.</li>
          <li>You may now click anywhere on the category to open and close it which means you no longer have to press the tiny little +/- button to open/close things.</li>
          <li>There is a new check box at the top that is checked by default. when unchecked, the feat window will hide all feats that you are not actually able to train. in practice this cuts about 60% of the elements out of the window making it a lot easier to find what you want but this will obviously shift up and down depending on test cases.</li>
          <li>There are two new buttons up top, collapse all and expand all. they collapse all and expand all categories, just as they do in the other two panels.</li>
          <li>Slightly modified the list of feats showed to the player during level up to exclude even more feats that they will never qualify for (right now we only show you a subsection and this cleans the subsection up just a bit/)</li>
          <li>The Granted Class Feats section at the top now shows the feats as they exist on you and not just their category, meaning that you actually see those feats and their icons right at the top without them being under a click block.</li>
          <li>The summary panel on the following page also now shows the feats as they exist sans category, meaning you see the feats and their icons without seeing the category and the feats are no longer under a click block.</li></ul></li>
          <li>Feat Swap Screen:<ul>
          <li>Feats now display with the levels taken next to them at a glance so it's easier to parse what levels you took feats at.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
          <li>Journals have a slightly more readable font and contrast.</li>
          <li>Hovering over your Enhancement Points now displays a formatted tooltip explaining some basics about your character, the points they've earned, and the tomes they've used.</li>
          <li class="patch">While on a Wilderness Area, selecting a quest from your quest journal now points an arrow on your minimap towards that quest.</li>

I dubbed the tree my "lefty-righty" tree during development. Unlike other Enhancement trees, this one had two conflicting sets of core abilities that overlapped each other, forcing a player to choose if they wanted to go from right to left or left to right depending on if they wanted darkness abilities or light-based ones. A player can also dip into both sides, forgoing a capstone BUT attaining elemental power to support the elemental Cleric domains. I think it's probably my best work in terms of revamps - an overhaul that breaks all of the rules and supported 3 conflicting playstyles in a way that feels fun!</span></li>

        <h2>Update 55: Isle of Dread</h2>
        <p>June 22nd, 2022</p>
      </div>
      <div class="features">
        <h3>Main Features:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Isle of Dread Expansion Pack Itemization</li>
        <li>Level Cap Increase<ul>
        <li>Level 32 Epic Destiny Abilities for Shadowdancer, Divine Crusader, Grandmaster of Flowers, Draconic Incarnation</li>
        <li>Level 31 and 32 Loot now drops!</li>
        <li>Cannith Crafting has been updated to support 31 and 32 items</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="balance">
        <h3>Balance and Small Features:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>You may now trade 100 pack ingredients for a Star Fragment, and 100 Star Fragments and 500 Threads of Fate for a Nebula Fragment.</li>
        <li>Enchantment DCs are now an option in Tier 3 of Magus of the Eclipse.</li>
        <li>Teleport items found within expansion packs have been upgraded! These items are now able to teleport you to all destinations that the other teleport items had access to - this means that if you have one of these items, you'll be able to teleport directly to the locations of all of them. You must own the item associated with the location you are attempting to teleport to. This means that, for example, when using the Sharn Boarding Pass, you'll be able to teleport to the Feywild if you own the Feywild Tuning Fork as a part of your account. However, you do not need to have the Tuning Fork with you to do this - which means that carrying one of these items is now equivalent to carrying all of them, potentially saving you inventory space. You may also drag these individual locations from the menu onto your hotbars, so if you need to reach a specific destination often, you can activate them from there instead of from your inventory. The following items are affected:<ul>
        <li>Isle of Dread Treasure Map</li>
        <li>Saltmarsh Compass</li>
        <li>Feywild Tuning Fork</li>
        <li>Sharn Boarding Pass</li>
        <li>Bottle of Mist</li></ul></li>
        <li>The Mysterious Ring in the Sands of Menechtarun adventure pack is now a little cooler!</li>
        <li class="patch">An acid damage over time effect from items has had its damage dice changed from 1d100 to 10d10 to raise the floor and provide less of a random spread (found in Legendary Greensteel, Legendary Alchemical Crafting, Dinosaur Bone Crafting)</li>
        <li class="patch">Potions of Sovereign Healing can now be used while moving.</li>
        <li class="patch">You can now apply the Legendary Dread Isle's Curse set to your Dinosaur Bone crafted equipment via a new Isle of Dread Set Augment.</li>
        <li class="patch">Quarterstaff bonus effects from Dinosaur Bone Crafting now automatically apply implement bonuses to your quarterstaff.</li>
        <li class="patch">Bonuses to ability scores from Dinosaur Bone Crafting are now increased while slotted into a Minor Artifact.</li>
