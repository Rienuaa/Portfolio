</ul>
<h3>Engineering:</h3>
<ul>
<li>There is a new gameplay option: Show Detailed Chest Information (Default: false). While true, the first time you touch a chest (and generate its loot) the chest will print out some information about its ransack info into your chat log. Only you can see this info.</li>
<li>A series of changes have been made to tooltip generation.<ul>
<li>The names of Feats and Enhancements are now bigger in their tooltips to make it easier to parse what they are.</li>
<li>SLA tooltips now display spell info, such as their spell point cost, spell DC, and spell school, automatically.</li>
<li>Certain aspects of enhancements no longer show in the tooltip (such as prerequisites) if you own the enhancement and are looking via your character sheet. When hovered over in the tree they will show their AP cost and prerequisites as usual.</ul></li></li>
<li>A series of large changes have been made to how we display Feats to the players:</li>
<li>Character Creation:</li>
<li>Feats now display in neat categories that are easier to parse and sort through.</li>
<li>The summary at the bottom and at the last stage in advancement shows you all feats without category view so that you just get a list of what feats you have without them being condensed underneath a click block.</li>
<li>The collapse/expand button up top plays nice with them so you can collapse all/expand all with one click.</li>
<li>Character Sheet:</li>
<li>Feats now display in neat categories that are easier to parse and sort through.</li>
<li>Collapse/expand button works with them.</li>
<li>Feats that are acquired on a temporary basis now display an indicator below their name stating as such.</li>
<li>Level Up Screen:</li>
<li>Categories now have well formatted labels that actually match the +/- button in relative vertical area, which makes everything look a little nicer.</li>
<li>You may now click anywhere on the category to open and close it which means you no longer have to press the tiny little +/- button to open/close things.</li>
<li>There is a new check box at the top that is checked by default. when unchecked, the feat window will hide all feats that you are not actually able to train. in practice this cuts about 60% of the elements out of the window making it a lot easier to find what you want but this will obviously shift up and down depending on test cases.</li>
<li>There are two new buttons up top, collapse all and expand all. they collapse all and expand all categories, just as they do in the other two panels.</li>
<li>Slightly modified the list of feats showed to the player during level up to exclude even more feats that they will never qualify for (right now we only show you a subsection and this cleans the subsection up just a bit/)</li>
<li>The Granted Class Feats section at the top now shows the feats as they exist on you and not just their category, meaning that you actually see those feats and their icons right at the top without them being under a click block.</li>
<li>The summary panel on the following page also now shows the feats as they exist sans category, meaning you see the feats and their icons without seeing the category and the feats are no longer under a click block.</li>
<li>Feat Swap Screen:</li>
<li>Feats now display with the levels taken next to them at a glance so it's easier to parse what levels you took feats at.</li>
<li>Journals have a slightly more readable font and contrast.</li>
<li>Hovering over your Enhancement Points now displays a formatted tooltip explaining some basics about your character, the points they've earned, and the tomes they've used.</li>
<li style="color:Blue;">While on a Wilderness Area, selecting a quest from your quest journal now points an arrow on your minimap towards that quest.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Update 55</h2>
<p>Release Date: June 22nd, 2022</p>
<h3>Main Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Isle of Dread Expansion Pack Itemization</li>
<li>Level Cap Increase<ul>
<li>Level 32 Epic Destiny Abilities for Shadowdancer, Divine Crusader, Grandmaster of Flowers, Draconic Incarnation</li>
<li>Level 31 and 32 Loot now drops!</li>
<li>Cannith Crafting has been updated to support 31 and 32 items</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<h3>Balance:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You may now trade 100 pack ingredients for a Star Fragment, and 100 Star Fragments and 500 Threads of Fate for a Nebula Fragment.</li>
<li>Enchantment DCs are now an option in Tier 3 of Magus of the Eclipse.</li>
<li>Teleport items found within expansion packs have been upgraded! These items are now able to teleport you to all destinations that the other teleport items had access to - this means that if you have one of these items, you'll be able to teleport directly to the locations of all of them. You must own the item associated with the location you are attempting to teleport to. This means that, for example, when using the Sharn Boarding Pass, you'll be able to teleport to the Feywild if you own the Feywild Tuning Fork as a part of your account. However, you do not need to have the Tuning Fork with you to do this - which means that carrying one of these items is now equivalent to carrying all of them, potentially saving you inventory space. You may also drag these individual locations from the menu onto your hotbars, so if you need to reach a specific destination often, you can activate them from there instead of from your inventory. The following items are affected:<ul>
<li>Isle of Dread Treasure Map</li>
<li>Saltmarsh Compass</li>
<li>Feywild Tuning Fork</li>
<li>Sharn Boarding Pass</li>
<li>Bottle of Mist</li></ul></li>

<li style="color:Blue;">An acid damage over time effect from items has had its damage dice changed from 1d100 to 10d10 to raise the floor and provide less of a random spread (found in Legendary Greensteel, Legendary Alchemical Crafting, Dinosaur Bone Crafting)</li>

<li style="color:Blue;">You can now apply the Legendary Dread Isle's Curse set to your Dinosaur Bone crafted equipment via a new Isle of Dread Set Augment.</li>
<li style="color:Blue;">Quarterstaff bonus effects from Dinosaur Bone Crafting now automatically apply implement bonuses to your quarterstaff.</li>
